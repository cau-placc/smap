helpLanguages
Which programming languages are supported?
<p>
In general, Smap can support any programming language
provided that there exists some
language mode for <a href="http://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a>
and a safe execution environment via some web service.
Since the latter is more easy to install for declarative programming
languages, Smap currently supports the following languages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
 <b>Curry</b>: There are two execution environments provided for
 functional logic programs written in Curry:
 PAKCS, which compiles fairly fast, and
 KiCS2, which requires a considerably larger compilation time
 but is lazier for some features.
 For PAKCS, you can select between two systems: one computes
 all values of the initial expression <tt>main</tt> and the other one
 computes only the first value of the initial expression.
 KiCS2 can be used in a similar manner but has long execution
 times (which might cause a time out).
 Note that initial expressions of type <tt>IO</tt>
 are not allowed in all systems.
</li>
<li>
 <b>Haskell</b>: Functional programs written in Haskell are executed by
 <tt>runghc</tt>, which is part of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.
 Note that initial expressions <tt>main</tt> of type <tt>IO</tt>
 are not allowed.
</li>
<li>
 <b>Prolog</b>: Logic programs written in Prolog are executed by
 SWI-Prolog. Programs are executed in a sandbox (see library
 <tt>sandbox</tt> of SWI-Prolog).
</li>
</ul>

If you are are interested in the support for other languages,
please contact the Smap maintainer.
