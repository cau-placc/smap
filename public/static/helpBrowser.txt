What is the Browser?
<p>
The browser is the primary tool to search through and preview the
programs stored in Smap.
</p>
You can use the <em>Dashboard</em> to look at all programs
or filter programs by the implementation language
or keywords occurring in the title, decsription, or tags.
<p>
</p>
Once you found an interesting program, you can open it
in the browser or with [SmapIE](help-02) in order to execute and play with them.
If you open a program in the browser, you see more details
like a short description or the source code.
<p>
</p>
If you are signed in and you created this program, you can also delete it or
make it visible to others (if it was created as private).
Moreover, you can write a comment to a program
or add programs from other authors to your favorites.
