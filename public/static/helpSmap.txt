What is Smap?
<p>
Smap (a portmanteau for "<b>sma</b>ll <b>p</b>rograms") is primarily
an interactive source code editor that lets you write programs and
execute them online in various programming languages. In addition, Smap 
allows you to save and manage your programs and make them available
to other users.
For these purposes Smap provides two core components:
the [SmapIE](help-02) and the [Browser](help-03).
</p>
<p>
In the header of the main Smap view, you can perform a quick search
to find all programs containing a given keyword (like "quicksort")
in its title, description, or list of tags.
The list of such programs are shown in the [Browser](help-03).
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, you can create new programs in a specific programming language
with the [SmapIE](help-02).
</p>
<p>
Each program stored in Smap has a unique identifier (a number).
If you know this identifier, you can also use the "SmapIE" menu
to open this program directly in the [SmapIE](help-02).
