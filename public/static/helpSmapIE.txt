What is SmapIE?
<p>
SmapIE is an interactive source code editor and execution environment
for small programs. If you are signed in and your program
successfully executes, you can store your program and, thus, make
it available to everybody in the world.
If you want to keep it private for some time, you can also
set its status to private (and make it later visible with the
[Browser](help-03)).
</p>
<p>
If you don't want to sign in but use SmapIE just
to try out some program, you cannot store your program in Smap.
However, you can generate a URL to upload your program
at some later time to SmapIE.
For this purpose, generate an upload URL in SmapIE
(via the "Options" menu) and copy the generated link.
