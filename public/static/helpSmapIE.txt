What is SmapIE?
<p>
SmapIE is an interactive source code editor and execution environment
for small programs. If you are signed in and your program
successfully executes, you can store your program and, thus, make
it available to everybody in the world.
If you want to keep it private for some time, you can also
set its status to private (and make it later visible with the
[Browser](help-03)).
