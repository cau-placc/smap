Why should I sign in?
<p>
You can use Smap just to write and run some tiny program written in one
of the currently supported languages.
However, if you want to store your program in Smap so that
you can improve or show it to other interested people,
you must be signed in.
Furthermore, writing comments to other programs or add them
to your favorites is only possible if you are signed in.

If you are new to Smap and don't have an account,
you can simply sign up and create an account by choosing
a user name, password, and providing your email address.
